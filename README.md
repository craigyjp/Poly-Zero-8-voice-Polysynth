# Poly-Zero-8-voice-Polysynth
Based on the Hagiwo $9 DCO and the Polykit 16 filter cards

Work in progress, taking the earlier Seeed XIAO RP2040 dual oscillator monosynth and creating an 8 voice Polysynth based on this but using Waveshare Zero RP2040 instead the Seeed.

Things to do

Fix the poly, uni, mono modes and add note priority buttons etc.

Wire the front panel Teensy controller to the voice card motherboard with a 32 way ribbon cable.
