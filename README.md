# Poly-Zero-8-voice-Polysynth
Based on the Hagiwo $9 DCO and the Polykit 16 filter cards

Work in progress, taking the earlier Seeed XIAO RP2040 dual oscillator monosynth and creating an 8 voice Polysynth based on this but using Waveshare Zero RP2040 instead the Seeed.

The FX board and a new menu system has been created to display groups of parameters within a module such as LFO, DCO1, DCO2, Filter, ADSR etc.

Things to do

Add pitchbend over MIDI

Create a front panel.
